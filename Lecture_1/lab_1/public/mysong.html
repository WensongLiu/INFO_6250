				Look at the stars
				Look how they shine for you
				And everything you do
				Yeah, they were all yellow

				I came along
				I wrote a song for you
				And all the things you do
				And it was called yellow

				So then I took my turn
				Oh what a thing to have done
				And it was all yellow

				Your skin
				Oh yeah, your skin and bones
				Turn into something beautiful
				You know, you know I love you so
				You know I love you so

				I swam across
				I jumped across for you
				Oh what a thing to do

				'Cause you were all yellow
				I drew a line
				I drew a line for you
				Oh what a thing to do
				And it was all yellow

				Your skin
				Oh yeah, your skin and bones
				Turn into something beautiful
				You know, for you I'd bleed myself dry
				For you I'd bleed myself dry

				I's true
				Look how they shine for you
				Look how they shine for you
				Look how they shine for 
				Look how they shine for you
				Look how they shine for you
				Look how they shine

				Look at the stars
				Look how they shine for you
				And all the things that you do
