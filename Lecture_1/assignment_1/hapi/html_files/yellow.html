					About "Yellow"<br/>
					<br/>
					“Yellow” is the fifth track and second single off <br/>
					of 
					<a href="http://localhost:3000/coldplay">Coldplay</a>’s 2000 debut album 
					<a href="http://localhost:3000/parachutes">Parachutes</a>.<br/>
					It is their oldest and its most enduring hit, <br/>
					continuing to be a celebrated staple of live performances even today.<br/>
					The title of the song came from the feel of the band during its composition, <br/>
					which was described as filled with “brightness and hope and devotion”.<br/>
					However, the lyrical content was inspired by <br/>
					lead singer 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Martin">Chris Martin</a>’s “unrequited love”.<br/>

					And everything you do<br/>
					Yeah, they were all yellow<br/>

					I came along<br/>
					I wrote a song for you<br/>
					And all the things you do<br/>
					And it was called yellow<br/>
					<br/>
					So then I took my turn<br/>
					Oh what a thing to have done<br/>
					And it was all yellow<br/>
					<br/>
					Your skin<br/>
					Oh yeah, your skin and bones<br/>
					Turn into something beautiful<br/>
					You know, you know I love you so<br/>
					You know I love you so<br/>
					<br/>
					I swam across<br/>
					I jumped across for you<br/>
					Oh what a thing to do<br/>
					<br/>
					'Cause you were all yellow<br/>
					I drew a line<br/>
					I drew a line for you<br/>
					Oh what a thing to do<br/>
					And it was all yellow<br/>
					<br/>
					Your skin<br/>
					Oh yeah, your skin and bones<br/>
					Turn into something beautiful<br/>
					You know, for you I'd bleed myself dry<br/>
					For you I'd bleed myself dry<br/>
